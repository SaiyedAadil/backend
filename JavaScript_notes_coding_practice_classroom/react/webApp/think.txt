array map method:
    in jsx syntax;

missing key prop for element: 
    ,,, react: all elems are same;
            but in eyes of jsx is a key as prop
    .. you need to have a unique identifies so that react neeeds to differentiate; in react;

yt: <map method works in react js>;
what is state:
why, using/happening in state in react?

work of holding the data / rendering the data;
divide the separation of the stuff; usage of components


. real dom;
. virtual dom;
    . it's reflecting/updating in virtual dom;
    . it's not updating in real dom
    . process known as Diffing process
and the function to update the state, useState()
1st val: state, 2nd is useState;

you cannot directly manipulate state or in js(variable)

clear, got it!
internal data stored with update functionality;

hooks created to need of inheritance like in classes;
tomorrow: 
    . state, with conditional rendering;
