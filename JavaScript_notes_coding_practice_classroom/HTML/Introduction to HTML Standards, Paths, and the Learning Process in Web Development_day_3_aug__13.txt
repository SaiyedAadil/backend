Introduction to HTML Standards, Paths, and the Learning Process in Web Development
- you've compiled notes on HTML and some foundational concepts, particularly regarding standards, paths, and how learning is an ongoing process in web development.

Breakdown of your notes:

1. HTML Standards:
   - Who maintains the standard?
     - The W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) is responsible for maintaining web standards.
   - How do they maintain these standards?
     - W3C establishes a set of rules and regulations that define how web technologies should function to ensure consistency across browsers and devices.

2. Absolute Path:
   - An absolute path is a full web address that provides the complete path to a resource (such as an image).
   - Example:
     - An image stored on a different server is referenced in the `src` attribute with its full URL (absolute path).

3. Hypertext and Hyperlinks:
   - Hypertext refers to text with links to other text, which is where the term hyperlink comes from in HTML.
   - HTML is based on this idea, using hyperlinks to connect different pages or resources.

4. Learning and Knowledge Acquisition:
   - The idea is that formal education only provides a portion (20-30%) of what you'll need to know in the field of web development. The rest comes from:
     - Your own research (20%)
     - Real-world job experience (20%)
     - A certain percentage will always be unknown or beyond reach, representing the vast "ocean" of knowledge.
