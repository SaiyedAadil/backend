Understanding URLs, DNS, and the Behind-the-Scenes Processes in Web Development

notes about web basics! Hereâ€™s a simplified overview of those concepts:

### URL
- Definition: A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access a specific resource on the internet.

### Resources Loaded
- Process: When you visit a website, various resources load in stages:
  - Webpages (HTML, CSS)
  - Images
  - Videos
  - Fonts
- Data Transmission: These resources come in packets, loading piece by piece.

### DNS (Domain Name System)
- Function: DNS translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses, allowing browsers to locate servers.
- Example: When using Google Maps, DNS helps identify your location via IP.

### Internet
- Definition: The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers.
- Connection: Each device is assigned an IP address, which is difficult to remember compared to domain names.

### Metadata
- Definition: Metadata provides information about a website, often included in the `<head>` tag of HTML.

### Body Tag
- Definition: The `<body>` tag contains the main content displayed on a webpage.

### Localhost URL
- Definition: A localhost URL refers to a web server running on your local machine (e.g., accessing via port 5500).

### Tags and Standards
- Question: What do tags do? Tags define the structure and content of a webpage.
- Question: What is the use of `<!DOCTYPE html>`? It declares the HTML version being used, ensuring compliance with standards.

### Key Points
- Client/Server Model: A lot happens behind the scenes in the client-server architecture, where files are stored and retrieved.
