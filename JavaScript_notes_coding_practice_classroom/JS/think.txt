JS Dom Expense Tracker
Create a basic Expense Tracker application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to let users add expenses, display them in a list, and keep track of the total amount spent.

Requirements:
    . HTML Structure:
        . A form with input fields for the expense name, amount, and a submit button to add the expense.
        . A list to display the added expenses (each entry should show the expense name and amount).
        . A section to display the total expenses.

CSS Styling:
    . Style the form, expense list, and total expense section.
    . Make the UI clean and intuitive, using appropriate fonts, colors, and layout techniques.
    . Use Flexbox or Grid to organize the layout.

JavaScript Logic:
    . When the form is submitted, capture the input values (expense name and amount).
    . Add the new expense to a list and update the display.
    . Keep a running total of all expenses and update it whenever a new expense is added.
    . Allow the user to delete individual expenses from the list, and adjust the total accordingly.
