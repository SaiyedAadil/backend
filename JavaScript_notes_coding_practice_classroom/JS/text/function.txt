Title: Functions, Default Parameters, and Arrow Functions in JavaScript

A suitable topic for these notes could be:

**"Functions, Default Parameters, and Arrow Functions in JavaScript"**

This title reflects the key topics covered:
1. **Functions**: Explaining how parameters and arguments work, and how default values can be set in function parameters.
2. **Scopes**: Clarification of block-scoped and global-scoped variables within functions.
3. **Type casting**: The automatic conversion of data types (e.g., string to number) within operations.
4. **Arrow functions**: Introduction to arrow function syntax and behavior, including how `return` affects the execution of code.

This title would give a clear understanding of JavaScript's function-related concepts. Would you like to refine or expand on any part of it?

### Breakdown of Your Notes on Functions

#### Function Definition and Default Parameters

```javascript
function add(a = 7, b) {
    var res = a + b;
    return res;
}
```

- **Default Parameter**: The parameter `a` has a default value of `7`. If `a` is not provided when the function is called, it will default to `7`. The parameter `b` does not have a default value, so it must be provided; otherwise, it will be `undefined`.

#### Function Invocation

- You can call the function multiple times:
  ```javascript
  add(); // Returns 7 + undefined, which is NaN
  add(5); // Returns 5 + undefined, which is NaN
  add(5, 3); // Returns 5 + 3, which is 8
  ```

#### Scope

- Variables defined inside a function are not accessible outside that function. This is important for avoiding naming conflicts.

#### Dynamic Function Calls

```javascript
const addition = add(true, 5);
```
- Here, `true` gets coerced to `1`, so the result is `1 + 5`, which is `6`.

#### Type Casting

- JavaScript automatically converts types when necessary (e.g., strings to numbers).

### Arrow Functions

```javascript
const subtract = function (a, b = 10) {
    var res = a - b;
    return res;
};
```
- Arrow functions provide a concise syntax and can have default parameters as well.

#### Example of Arrow Function

```javascript
let multiply = (a, b) => {
    var res = a * b;
    return res;
};
```
- The `return` statement exits the function, and any code after it (like `console.log`) will not execute.

#### Invocations

```javascript
console.log(multiply(5, 5)); // Outputs: 25
```

### Key Points

1. **Default Parameters**: Useful for providing fallback values.
2. **Scope**: Variables declared inside a function are not accessible outside.
3. **Type Coercion**: JavaScript automatically converts values when needed, such as booleans to numbers.
4. **Arrow Functions**: Provide a more concise way to write functions, but they also do not have their own `this`, which is important to remember in certain contexts.

### Summary

Your notes effectively cover the basics of defining functions, using default parameters, handling scopes, and writing arrow functions in JavaScript. They also touch on the concept of type coercion, which is essential in JavaScriptâ€™s loosely typed nature. If you have any specific areas you'd like to explore further or clarify, feel free to ask!
