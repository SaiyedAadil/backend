    . Here are the notes organized:
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Questions:**
    . - **What else do we store?**
    .   - Nowadays, we store various things in key-value pairs.
    . 
    . - **How does it store behind the scenes?**
    .   - Needs exploration of how key-value pairs are stored at a low level.
    . 
    . - **What does the `map` method do?**
    .   - It acts as a loop, calling a function on every element.
    .   - Performs an operation on each element and stores the result in a new array.
    . 
    . - **How do I remove a reference type if I don’t want it in my code?**
    .   - Two major ways:
    .     1. Use the `for in` loop.
    .     2. (The second method is missing here).
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **For-in Loop (Object-Specific Loop):**
    . - **Purpose:** Loop specific to objects, used to iterate through object keys.
    . 
    . - **Syntax:**
    .   ```javascript
    .   for (let key in obj1) {
    .       // code block
    .   }
    .   ```
    .   - Initializes a "key" and iterates over all keys in `obj1`.
    .   - Logs each key in `console.log(key)`.
    . 
    . - **Creating properties in another object:**
    .   - You can create properties in `obj2` dynamically while iterating through `obj1`.
    .   - **Bracket Notation:** Always use bracket notation for dynamic keys:
    .     ```javascript
    .     obj2[key] = value;  // Correct for dynamic key
    .     ```
    .   - **Dot Notation:** Can't be used in this case because `obj2.key` looks for a key named "key," not the dynamic value of `key`.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Programming/Logic Building Concepts:**
    . - **HTTP Protocols:**
    .   - **Sending:** Use `JSON.stringify()`.
    .   - **Receiving:** Use `JSON.parse()`.
    . 
    . - **Objects in Development:**
    .   - Objects and arrays are fundamental in development.
    .   - Data in structured formats are key to frontend-backend communication (request-response).
    . 
    . - **Logic Building:**
    .   - Questions should explore:
    .     - Different scenarios.
    .     - Edge cases.
    .     - Optimization methods.
    .     - Multiple approaches to problems.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Class Notes (Objects and Methods):**
    . - **Encapsulation:**
    .   - Objects encapsulate multiple data types about a single entity in one place.
    . 
    . - **Map Method:**
    .   - Calls a callback function on each array element.
    .   - Returns a new array storing the result of each operation on the elements.
    . 
    . - **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
    .   - A notation used to represent key-value pairs.
    .   - Similar to XML but more widely adopted for communication across languages.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Key Concepts:**
    . 1. **Objects in Programming:**
    .    - Understand how to access and manipulate objects.
    . 
    . 2. **Shallow Copy:**
    .    - Copies only the first level of an object, not nested properties.
    .    - Example:
    .      ```javascript
    .      let obj2 = { ...obj1 };  // Shallow copy using spread operator
    .      ```
    . 
    . 3. **Deep Copy:**
    .    - For a complete copy of an object (including nested objects), use `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`:
    .      ```javascript
    .      let deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
    .      ```
    . 
    . 4. **Spread Operator:**
    .    - Creates a shallow copy of objects.
    .    - Deep copy requires a different approach like `JSON.parse()`.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Programming World Fundamentals:**
    . - **Why learn objects in JavaScript?**
    .   - They are essential to store and manage data in a structured way, vital for communication in development (frontend-backend).
    . 
    . - **Reference Types:**
    .   - Objects in JavaScript are reference types, meaning they hold a reference (memory location), not a value.
    . 
    . - **Serialization:**
    .   - Converting objects to strings (serialization) and back (deserialization) is key for data transfer:
    .     - `JSON.stringify()`: Converts object to JSON.
    .     - `JSON.parse()`: Converts JSON back to an object.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Methods in Objects:**
    . - **Example Method in Object:**
    .   - `changePrimary: function () {}` is a method within an object.
    . 
    . - **This Keyword:**
    .   - Behavior varies based on the context in which it is used.
    . 
    . - **Serialization:**
    .   - `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` are responsible for:
    .     - Shallow and deep copy of objects.
    .     - Converting between JavaScript objects and JSON strings.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Important Topics Covered:**
    . - **Objects & Methods:**
    .   - Objects, methods, and loops (like `for-in`) are crucial for data handling and logic building.
    . 
    . - **Logic:**
    .   - Example logic problem: Handling a person’s contact number, determining if it's primary or not.
    . 
    . ---
    . 
    . ### **Interesting Concepts:**
    . - **Reflection of Objects:**
    .   - Shallow copy creates a reflection of an object (first layer).
    .   - Deep copy is for nested objects.
    .   - Example of shallow copy:
    .     ```javascript
    .     let obj2 = { ...obj1 };  // Spread operator (one-level shallow copy)
    .     ```
    .   - **Deep copy:** Use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` for deep copy (for nested objects).
    .

    Here’s a comprehensive summary of your notes on JavaScript objects, focusing on storage, manipulation, and related concepts:

### Key Questions and Concepts

#### 1. What Do We Store in Objects?
- **Data Types**: Various types of data in key-value pairs, allowing structured storage for entities (e.g., user information).
  
#### 2. Behind the Scenes: How Objects Store Data
- **Reference Types**: Objects are stored in memory by reference, meaning changes to an object affect all references to it.

#### 3. Understanding the `map` Method
- **Functionality**: The `map` method iterates over an array, applying a callback function to each element, and returns a new array with the results of the operations.

#### 4. Removing References in Code
- **Removing References**: 
  - Use a `for...in` loop to iterate through keys and manipulate or remove properties.
  - Optionally, methods like `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, or `Object.entries()` can also help in handling object properties.

### The `for...in` Loop
- **Purpose**: Specifically designed for iterating over object properties.
- **Syntax**:
  ```javascript
  for (let key in obj1) {
      console.log(key); // Outputs each key in obj1
  }
  ```
- **How It Works**: 
  - Initializes a variable `key` to iterate over each property in the object.
  - Can be used to access values dynamically, but requires bracket notation for dynamic keys:
    ```javascript
    obj2[key] = obj1[key]; // Creates properties in obj2 using keys from obj1
    ```

### Programming and Logic Building
- **Data Handling**: 
  - **HTTP Protocols**: 
    - Sending data: `JSON.stringify()`
    - Receiving data: `JSON.parse()`
  - Objects and arrays are fundamental in data management for frontend and backend communication, creating structured formats for data exchange.

### Class Notes on Objects
- **Encapsulation**: Objects encapsulate multiple data points and methods, providing a single structure to manage related information.
- **Methods**: Functions defined within objects are referred to as methods.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- **Definition**: A lightweight data interchange format that structures data as key-value pairs, allowing easy communication across programming languages.

### Important Concepts
- **Shallow vs. Deep Copy**:
  - **Shallow Copy**: Copies only the first level of properties (nested objects remain referenced).
  - **Deep Copy**: Creates a complete copy, including nested objects, using methods like `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`.
  - **Spread Operator**: Allows for shallow copying of objects:
    ```javascript
    let obj2 = { ...obj1 };
    ```

### Additional Considerations
- **The `this` Keyword**: Refers to the current object context; its behavior varies based on the calling context.
- **Dynamic Property Access**: Always use bracket notation for dynamic keys in objects to avoid issues with dot notation.

### Conclusion
Understanding objects in JavaScript is essential for effective data storage and manipulation. This includes mastering object properties, methods, and various techniques for copying and referencing data.
