        . when you storing multiple data of a single person/entity is essentially known as encapsulation

 . what is object? // oops concept.. any definitio
    . what do you think an object is?
        . ans:
            . a real life entity
            . objects are considered as a real life entity
            . it has properties and values
            . this object, it has this property, it has this value.
            . ex: phone is also object, and specification, hardwares, softwares are values.
    . In js object: topics knowledge:
        . creation object method: many ways like
            . object literals like obj = {}
            .
        . encapsulation:
            . this obj become the data type where you encapsulate multiple data (this obj, become variable wehre you encapsulate multiple data)
            . 
        . we can add a function as well in key value pairs
        . everything in js is stored as an object
        . why is it stored in object...?
        . but that obj is essentially called as object:
            . how? all the necessary details, single entity.. direct creation are stored in 
            . school multiple student details -> array of objects: majorly used for
            . each object referring to one single entity.
        . (.)dot notation 
            . creation of key, and accessing key (.) notation
        . rules and regulations while creating the key/property/assigning value
    . how you access it, how you put values into it, but similar variable creation..
. questions: 
    . how you generate object out of classes?
        . classes are like they define the structure of how our object look like

. Notes:
    . // OOPs concep start with objects

// let obj = {
//     name: "name1",
//     class: "MERN",


// }
// a function is declared in a method is essentially known as method;

let obj = {}
let trainer = [];
obj["full name"] = "john deo";
obj.classNo = 5;
console.log(obj["full name"], obj);

Here's a concise summary of your notes on objects and encapsulation in JavaScript, along with some explanations of key concepts:

### Terminology and Concepts

#### 1. **Encapsulation**
- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the concept of storing multiple data points about a single entity within a single structure (e.g., an object). It allows you to bundle related properties and methods together, enhancing data organization and security.

#### 2. **What is an Object?**
- **Definition**: In JavaScript, an object is a real-life entity that has properties and values. It represents a collection of data and functionality that pertains to that entity.
- **Example**: A phone can be an object with specifications (like brand, model, etc.) as properties and their corresponding values.

#### 3. **Creating Objects**
- **Object Literals**: 
  ```javascript
  let obj = {};
  obj["full name"] = "Syed Sayeed";
  obj.classNo = 5;
  console.log(obj["full name"]); // Outputs: Syed Sayeed
  ```

- **Encapsulation in Objects**: Objects serve as data types where you can encapsulate multiple data points related to a single entity (like a studentâ€™s details).

#### 4. **Object Properties and Methods**
- **Adding Functions**: You can also add functions to objects as methods:
  ```javascript
  let person = {
      name: "John",
      greet: function() {
          console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
      }
  };
  person.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, John
  ```

#### 5. **Accessing Object Properties**
- **Dot Notation**: You can access properties using dot notation:
  ```javascript
  console.log(person.name); // Outputs: John
  ```

- **Bracket Notation**: Useful for property names that are not valid identifiers:
  ```javascript
  console.log(obj["full name"]); // Outputs: Syed Sayeed
  ```

#### 6. **Classes and Object Generation**
- **Classes**: Classes define the structure and blueprint for creating objects. You can generate objects from classes using the `new` keyword:
  ```javascript
  class Student {
      constructor(name, classNo) {
          this.name = name;
          this.classNo = classNo;
      }
  }
  
  let student1 = new Student("John Doe", 5);
  console.log(student1.name); // Outputs: John Doe
  ```

### Summary
- **Objects** are fundamental to JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). They allow you to encapsulate data and functionality related to real-life entities.
- You can create objects using literals, classes, and constructors, and access their properties using both dot and bracket notation.
- Understanding objects is crucial for efficient data management and structure in JavaScript applications.

Your notes dive into key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like **objects** and **encapsulation**. Here's a summarized breakdown:

### 1. **Encapsulation**:
- **Definition**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling multiple data items (or properties) together into a single entity (object).
- Example: An object stores various properties of a single entity, such as:
  ```js
  let person = {
      name: "Syed Sayeed",
      age: 25,
      occupation: "Engineer"
  };
  ```
  Here, `person` encapsulates different data (name, age, occupation).

### 2. **Objects in JavaScript**:
- **Definition**: An object is a real-life entity that has properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors).
- **Example**: 
  ```js
  let phone = {
      brand: "Apple",
      model: "iPhone 13",
      storage: "128GB"
  };
  ```
  The phone object has properties like `brand`, `model`, and `storage`.

- **Object Creation**: There are multiple ways to create objects:
  - **Object literals**: 
    ```js
    let obj = {};
    obj.name = "John Doe";
    ```
  - Using **constructors** or **classes** for creating structured objects (often for larger, complex programs).

### 3. **Accessing Object Properties**:
- **Dot notation**: The most common way to access properties.
  ```js
  console.log(obj.name); // Access the name property
  ```
- **Bracket notation**: Used when property names have spaces or special characters.
  ```js
  console.log(obj["full name"]); // Access properties with spaces
  ```

### 4. **Methods in Objects**:
- When a function is assigned as a value inside an object, it is referred to as a **method**:
  ```js
  let car = {
      brand: "Toyota",
      start: function() {
          console.log("Car started");
      }
  };
  car.start(); // Outputs: Car started
  ```

### 5. **Classes**:
- **Definition**: A class defines the structure of an object, like a blueprint. You generate objects from classes.
- **Example**:
  ```js
  class Person {
      constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }
  }
  let person1 = new Person("Alice", 30); // Creating an object from a class
  ```

Objects are fundamental to OOP as they allow you to model and manipulate real-world entities. Would you like to explore more about classes or any specific OOP concept?
