"Understanding ES6: Hoisting, let & const, Operators, and JavaScript Pitfalls"

This title reflects:
1. ES6 features such as the `let` and `const` keywords and their behavior with hoisting.
2. The behavior of assignment and comparison operators with different data types (strings vs. numbers).
3. Pitfalls in JavaScript, like reassignment with `let` and `const`, and comparison of incompatible data types.
4. Operator usage, including modulus and exponentiation (``), and how increment operations (`++a` vs `a++`) work.
