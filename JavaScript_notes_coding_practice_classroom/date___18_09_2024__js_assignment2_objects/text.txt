fizzBuzz problem solving:
first both condition 3 and 5 divisible:
why is that?
    . we gonna know, first both condition
It doesn't really mean, there are various application using reduce method:
    . asked to me interview question based on reduce method

    . next question :
        . what is factorial?
        . if 3 : 3 x 2 x 1;
        . edge case?
    . edge cases what? need to handle in coding...
.   why using reduce we using?
we have already know>>>
we dont' know: logic building;
// times>>>
remember: t = 7__52
important thing: 7__57 to 8__00 to 8__5-6
    . 8__8
intersting:
    . 8__11__ to ...
=================================================

programming/logic building : 
    . prime number:
        . you taking example of 2, 
        . but you have to think what if I give some other number
        . what could be the logic?
        . we already know this there are 2 multiples of a number, a number itself and 1.
        . 

=================================================
    . long method
    . lengthy method
    . short method
=================================================
remember:
    . Running more loops is not good for your optimize code.
    . The lesser loops you write, the faster your code runs.
    . function must return something
    . another method of forming this thing, 
    . there are typically two ways how program works
        1. there is recursive method : call same function itself again and again
        2. step by step
    
=================================================
important: 
    . factorial:
        . what we essentially do is?
        . newbie code will be: you start from for loop
        . but,
        . 
=================================================
questions: 
    . factorial, what is factorial?
    . when it says 3 factorial, what does it mean? ans: 3 x 2 x 1 (you are just multiplying until it reaches 1) 
    . what are edge cases? (scenarios which will give you wrong answers)
    . why are we writing these values(while writing loop)
    . why are we using reduce?
        . ans: you are not wanting any kind of filter, array, and you are expecting different data type as well (not necessary in array).
            1. because we are performing an operation at the end of the loop. 
            2. when we are expecting different data type in return
    . what is a prime number?
    . How do you check if there number prime or not? programmatically? (this will test your logic)
        . ans: the multiples of itself and 1
    . What logic can be used to check whether a give number is prime or not programmatically?
    . what is object? // oops concept.. any definitio
    . what do you think an object is?
        . ans:
            . a real life entity
            . objects are considered as a real life entity
            . it has properties and values
            . this object, it has this property, it has this value.
            . ex: phone is also object, and specification, hardwares, softwares are values.
    . In js object: topics knowledge:
        . creation object method: many ways like
            . object literals like obj = {}
            .
        . encapsulation:
            . this obj become the data type where you encapsulate multiple data (this obj, become variable wehre you encapsulate multiple data)
            . 
        . we can add a function as well in key value pairs
        . everything in js is stored as an object
        . why is it stored in object...?
        . but that obj is essentially called as object:
            . how? all the necessary details, single entity.. direct creation are stored in 
            . school multiple student details -> array of objects: majorly used for
            . each object referring to one single entity.
        . (.)dot notation 
            . creation of key, and accessing key (.) notation
        . rules and regulations while creating the key/property/assigning value
    . how you access it, how you put values into it, but similar variable creation..


=================================================
interesting: 
    . interview questions based on topic(any)
    . like reduce method, objects etc...
    . the way you are writing a property
    . creation of object : many methods/ways
=================================================
terminology: 
    . encapsulation
