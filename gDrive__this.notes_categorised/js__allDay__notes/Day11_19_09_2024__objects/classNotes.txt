    . when you order, it's actually behind the scenes do this information structure in object format
    . that data is only information
    . in any application you take,
    . the core thing is,
        . you're capturing the data and sending it to someone
    . this is the lowest level of that entire process:
        . lowest level system design
        . where you're starting, where does at story begins
        . story begins from this

let's discuss methods in objects:
    . I'm creating a method in my person object:

    . what map function essentially do
        . map function essentially does is
            . 1 is, it performs an operation on each element
            . 2 is, the operation is again, stored in a new array
            . it generates an array, and stores the result of each operation on each element
    . spread operator
    
    . in js, we call it serialization of objects:
        . json.stringify()
        . json.parse()

concepts:
    . shallow copy --> 1st level, for in loop
    . deep copy --> deep level, JSON
