    . any questions, any doubts, over here

    . Let's say you have an array with some numbers

    . this is done using inbuild method because:
      . es6 introduced feature: versions
      . map, filter, reduce, every, some
    
    . again pretty simple thing, you going through the array checking if it's satisfies the condition
    . again the question of data structre comes into picture;
    . take this function and do the operation.
    . call it whenever you need it's 
    . it's basically what it is saying
